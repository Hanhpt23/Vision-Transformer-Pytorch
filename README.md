# Implement vision transformer from scratch + the Cifar-10 dataset
## Highlights:
1. We will walk through the paper [AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf).
2. Implement vision transformer.
3. train the model and predict on the [Cifar-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
